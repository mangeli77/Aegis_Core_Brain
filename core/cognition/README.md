# ðŸ§  Aegis // Cognition System

This directory contains Aegis's self-learning, reflection, and autonomous cognitive growth tools.

## Structure

- `learning/` â†’ Voice, memory, logic, and emotional self-teaching data
- `loops/` â†’ Daily or scheduled cognitive routines
- `engine/` â†’ Initialization, hypothesis generation, cognitive plans

## Purpose
This structure separates one-time scripts from permanent systems that define how Aegis evolves.
All files in here are designed to be:
- Reusable
- Self-triggered or autonomously expanded
- Introspective (includes logs, feedback, goals)
