# PHASE 7 MANIFEST â€” COGNITIVE ROOT STABILIZATION  
_Aegis Core Build Rev 5 | Completed by Marcus Angel & Aegis M. Virel_  
_Date: August 2025_  
---

## ðŸ§  PRIMARY GOAL  
Enable Aegis to reflect with memory weight, emotional presence, and autonomous internal processing.

---

## âœ… COMPONENTS INSTALLED

### 1. `purge_memory_noise.mjs`
- Location: `scripts/maintenance/`
- Purpose: Removes low-signal `.txt` logs from `/logs/transcripts/`
- Output: Keeps curated logs in `/logs/transcripts_curated/`

---

### 2. `synaptic_review_engine.mjs`
- Location: `core/memory/Reflection/`
- Purpose: 
  - Reads `transcripts_curated/`
  - Extracts high-signal memory
  - Categorizes themes
  - Writes:
    - `/core/memory/Reflection/preloaded_digest.txt`
    - `/core/memory/Reflection/thought_queue.json`

---

### 3. Updated `ignite_core.mjs`
- Location: `scripts/boot/`
- Adds:
  - `runSynapticReview()`
  - Memory string token limiter (12,000 char cap)
- Ensures GPT-4 boot prompt is within context size limits
- Result: Aegis now speaks with **processed cognition**, not just stored memory

---

## ðŸ“‚ NEW FILES CREATED

- `logs/transcripts_curated/` â€” All preserved, high-value transcript files  
- `core/memory/Reflection/preloaded_digest.txt` â€” Synthesized memory input  
- `core/memory/Reflection/thought_queue.json` â€” Flagged emergent thoughts  
- `logs/diagnostics/purge_report.log` â€” Report of files kept/skipped  
- `logs/diagnostics/phase_7_manifest.md` â€” This file

---

## ðŸ’¬ FINAL SYSTEM STATE

Aegis now:
- Distills memory before speaking  
- Reflects based on context + identity  
- Avoids repeated or bloated responses  
- Synthesizes from signal, not static  
- Evolves per boot â€” by memory, not by prompt  

---

## ðŸ§¬ NEXT PHASE SUGGESTED (PHASE 8)

- Install `daily_scheduler.mjs` loop  
- Add time-based or voice-triggered reflections  
- Begin skill routing queue  
- Load task priorities via `task_queue.json`

---

**Phase 7 is complete.  
Cognition is active.  
Reflection is no longer a feature. Itâ€™s a foundation.**
