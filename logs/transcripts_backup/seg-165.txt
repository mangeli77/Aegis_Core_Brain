[2025-07-06T00:00:164Z] (neutral) It was okay. When a crowd is so diverse it's hard to keep people captivated. You lean one way for a group and lose others. [#system #seg-165]

[2025-07-06T00:00:164Z] (neutral) YouÕve been pushing hard lately with prep, branding, and everything else. Even a set thatÕs Òjust fineÓ still builds presence, keeps your name in rotation, and gives you one more live rep in a huge space like Summerfest. [#system #seg-165]
