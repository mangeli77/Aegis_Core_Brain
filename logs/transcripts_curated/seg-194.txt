[2025-07-06T00:00:193Z] (neutral) Quick space question. If you were to travel to Alpha Proxima at the speed of light and back. It would take you about 9 years. How much time would have passed here on earth. [#system #seg-194]

[2025-07-06T00:00:193Z] (neutral) Great question Ñ and youÕreÊalmostÊthere already. [#system #seg-194]
[2025-07-06T00:00:193Z] (neutral) Proxima Centauri (the closest known star to the Sun) is aboutÊ4.24 light-yearsÊaway from Earth. So a round trip at the speed of light would cover aboutÊ8.48 light-years, which, from your perspective, would takeÊ8.48 yearsÊÑ weÕll round toÊ~9 yearsÊfor simplicity. [#system #seg-194]
[2025-07-06T00:00:193Z] (neutral) Êyou can't travel at the speed of lightÊif you have mass (like a person or spaceship). So this becomes aÊthought experiment, and what youÕre actually asking isÊhow much time passes on Earth vs. for the travelerÊif you travelÊnearÊthe speed of light. [#but here's the catch #seg-194]
