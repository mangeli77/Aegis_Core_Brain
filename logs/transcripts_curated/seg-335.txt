[2025-07-06T00:00:334Z] (neutral) Hi Abby, [#system #seg-335]
[2025-07-06T00:00:334Z] (positive) Thank you so much for the thoughtful overview! This sounds like an incredible eventÑand I love the direction youÕre headed. IÕd be honored to be considered for a celebration of that size and significance, especially one held right at the ABC Supply Stadium. ThatÕs an amazing backdrop. [#system #love #seg-335]
[2025-07-06T00:00:334Z] (neutral) I completely understand the importance of setting the right tone for such a large and diverse crowd. You can absolutely count on a clean, upbeat, family-friendly mix that keeps the energy flowing while still giving space for your emcee and the Ken Hendricks Award presentation. [#system #seg-335]
[2025-07-06T00:00:334Z] (neutral) My style leans boutique and environment-awareÑso I adapt each performance to the flow of the event and the vibe of the crowd, rather than sticking to a fixed playlist or overly ÒclubbyÓ feel. Think high-end DJ service with polish, personality, and professionalism. [#system #seg-335]
[2025-07-06T00:00:334Z] (positive) IÕd love to schedule a quick call to walk you through options, answer any questions, and learn more about how I can best support your vision. [#system #love #seg-335]
[2025-07-06T00:00:334Z] (neutral) Let me know what times might work best this week or nextÑIÕll make it easy. [#system #seg-335]
