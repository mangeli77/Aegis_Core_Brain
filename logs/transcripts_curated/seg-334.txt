[2025-07-06T00:00:333Z] (productive) 00 PM to 9:00 PM. Around 3:30 PM, there will be a 30Ð45 minute presentation to honor associates receiving our prestigious Ken Hendricks Award. That would be the only scheduled break in music as of now. WeÕre also planning to have an emcee this year who will help announce activities and offerings around the field. The event has a county fair feel and typically draws around 3,000 attendees, including associates and their families. Because of the diverse crowd, weÕd be looking for a clean, upbeat, and family-friendly music mix throughout the event. At this point, I donÕt believe we would need any staging, sound reinforcement, or lighting beyond whatÕs required for the DJ performance, as we already have a production crew on site handling the rest. Looking forward to chatting more soon! [#hi marcus, yes, we can absolutely set up a time to chat! in the meantime, i wanted to give you a quick overview of the event before we connect. this is our annual corporate celebration for abc supply associates. weõre still in the early planning stages and are currently exploring which vendors weõd like to bring in. in the past, weõve had a live band, but this year weõre considering going with a dj, which is why i wanted to reach out and learn more about you and your offerings to see if this could be a good fit. the event will be held outdoors at abc supply stadium, located at 217 shirland ave, beloit, wi 53511. we would need music coverage from approximately 3 #seg-334]

[2025-07-06T00:00:333Z] (productive) 00 PM to 9:00 PM. Around 3:30 PM, there will be a 30Ð45 minute presentation to honor associates receiving our prestigious Ken Hendricks Award. That would be the only scheduled break in music as of now. WeÕre also planning to have an emcee this year who will help announce activities and offerings around the field. The event has a county fair feel and typically draws around 3,000 attendees, including associates and their families. Because of the diverse crowd, weÕd be looking for a clean, upbeat, and family-friendly music mix throughout the event. At this point, I donÕt believe we would need any staging, sound reinforcement, or lighting beyond whatÕs required for the DJ performance, as we already have a production crew on site handling the rest. Looking forward to chatting more soon! [#hi marcus, yes, we can absolutely set up a time to chat! in the meantime, i wanted to give you a quick overview of the event before we connect. this is our annual corporate celebration for abc supply associates. weõre still in the early planning stages and are currently exploring which vendors weõd like to bring in. in the past, weõve had a live band, but this year weõre considering going with a dj, which is why i wanted to reach out and learn more about you and your offerings to see if this could be a good fit. the event will be held outdoors at abc supply stadium, located at 217 shirland ave, beloit, wi 53511. we would need music coverage from approximately 3 #seg-334]
