[2025-07-06T00:00:1445Z] (neutral) ffi-napiÊ(used byÊvosk) is ancient, and its native code bindings canÕt compile under ARM (Apple Silicon). But using Node underÊRosetta (Intel emulation), compilation works. [#system #seg-1446]
[2025-07-06T00:00:1445Z] (productive) Once it builds, you can switch back to ARM-native node Ñ weÕll optimize for that later if needed. [#system #seg-1446]
