[2025-07-06T00:00:195Z] (neutral) If youÊcouldÊtravel at exactly theÊspeed of light, the round trip would takeÊ8.48 years from EarthÕs perspective, but since no time passes for light (photons experienceÊzeroÊtime),Êno time would pass for the traveler. [#system #seg-196]

[2025-07-06T00:00:195Z] (neutral) About 9 years would pass on Earth. But for you, traveling at light speed, no time would pass at all. [#system #seg-196]

[2025-07-06T00:00:195Z] (neutral) Let's mix this up. What if you travelled at 1/2 the speed of light? [#system #seg-196]

[2025-07-06T00:00:195Z] (positive) Love it Ñ this makes the scenario more realistic (relatively speaking ??), and introduces meaningfulÊtime dilationÊwithout getting too close to the speed limit. [#system #love #seg-196]
