[2025-07-06T00:00:342Z] (neutral) Hi Abby, [#system #seg-343]
[2025-07-06T00:00:342Z] (neutral)  [#thank you again for the thoughtful message! based on what you shared, hereõs what iõm hearing so farñand please feel free to correct or add to anything #seg-343]
[2025-07-06T00:00:342Z] (neutral) * This is a large-scale, outdoor corporate celebration at ABC Supply Stadium with a relaxed, county fair atmosphere. [#system #seg-343]
[2025-07-06T00:00:342Z] (neutral) * YouÕre expecting around 3,000 attendees, including families and kids, so the tone should remain upbeat, clean, and inclusive. [#system #seg-343]
[2025-07-06T00:00:342Z] (neutral) 30PM. [#* music would run from 3pmð9pm, with a dedicated 30ð45 minute presentation window for the ken hendricks award around 3 #seg-343]
[2025-07-06T00:00:342Z] (neutral) * There will be an emcee handling announcements and activities across the field. [#system #seg-343]
[2025-07-06T00:00:342Z] (productive) * A production team is already in place, so sound and staging are largely coveredÑmy focus would be purely on the DJ and musical programming side. [#system #seg-343]
[2025-07-06T00:00:342Z] (positive) That all sounds like a fantastic setupÑand I love that youÕre being intentional with the experience this year. [#system #love #seg-343]
[2025-07-06T00:00:342Z] (neutral) From my side, I approach events like this less as a ÒperformanceÓ and more as an ongoing soundscape that supports and uplifts the overall environment. With a crowd this size and a layout thatÕs spread across the stadium, itÕs not about having people stand and watch a DJÑitÕs about keeping the energy right across multiple zones, from vendor booths to family areas to the presentation. [#system #seg-343]
[2025-07-06T00:00:342Z] (neutral) Rather than a continuous six-hour set, I typically recommend pacing the day in curated musical blocksÑgiving space for natural breaks, the emceeÕs flow, and even just auditory breathing room so the event doesnÕt feel over-programmed. [#system #seg-343]
[2025-07-06T00:00:342Z] (positive) IÕd love to jump on a quick call to walk through a few flexible approaches and see how we can best complement the vision your team is building. [#system #love #seg-343]
[2025-07-06T00:00:342Z] (neutral) Let me know a time that works for youÑIÕll make it easy. [#system #seg-343]
