[2025-07-06T00:00:350Z] (neutral) Hi Abby, [#system #seg-351]
[2025-07-06T00:00:350Z] (neutral) Thanks so much for the overviewÑthis sounds like a fantastic event, and I appreciate the level of thought youÕve already put into it. A celebration of that scale, with such a meaningful purpose behind it, deserves an atmosphere thatÕs fun, dynamic, and dialed into the audience. [#system #seg-351]
[2025-07-06T00:00:350Z] (productive) IÕll be honestÑwhat caught my attention most was the fact that youÕre approaching this as more than just a ÒDJ show.Ó For an outdoor, family-focused event like this, itÕs less about watching someone perform behind a booth and more about crafting an immersive soundscape that supports the experience. ThatÕs exactly where I thrive. [#system #seg-351]
[2025-07-06T00:00:350Z] (neutral) Rather than playing straight through for six hours, I often recommend shaping the music around your other programmingÑproviding curated sets that elevate the energy during key windows, help transition between moments, and give your emcee space to shine without competing for attention. It keeps the vibe fresh, avoids fatigue, and ultimately serves the crowd better. [#system #seg-351]
[2025-07-06T00:00:350Z] (positive) IÕd love to hop on a quick call to share how we could structure the flow, build in breaks, and still deliver something polished and professionalÑwithout it turning into a one-man marathon. [#system #love #seg-351]
[2025-07-06T00:00:350Z] (neutral) Let me know what works for your schedule. Looking forward to connecting! [#system #seg-351]
