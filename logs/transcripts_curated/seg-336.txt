[2025-07-06T00:00:335Z] (neutral) I like this but I'd like to hear another option. Maybe now isn't the time, but as a DJ I think it's totally weird to have DJs in front of a large audience of actual Adults. This isn't Ultra Miami, or some techno stadium set in Germany. I never understood the appeal of people watching a grown ass man behind a table pressing play, as they listen to him drop other peoples music. The ONLY way I understand this is then the production and Lighting designs are so intense with graphics that are time coded to his tracks. Now that's a show at least. I SAY THIS AND IM A dj. I think a DJ is a nice fill!! To pepper I between other talent. I don't know how to pitch this nor do I think I want to dj for 6 hours like that. [#system #seg-336]
