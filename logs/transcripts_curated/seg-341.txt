[2025-07-06T00:00:340Z] (neutral) Hi Abby, [#system #seg-341]
[2025-07-06T00:00:340Z] (positive) Thank you again for the detailed overviewÑthis sounds like an incredible event, and IÕd love the opportunity to contribute to such a meaningful celebration. [#system #love #seg-341]
[2025-07-06T00:00:340Z] (neutral) Based on what you described, I get the sense that this wonÕt be a ÒperformanceÓ DJ setup so much as a curated musical backboneÑcreating an atmosphere that supports everything happening around the stadium. Whether guests are at booths, watching the award ceremony, or walking the field with their families, the right soundtrack ties it all together. [#system #seg-341]
[2025-07-06T00:00:340Z] (neutral) I typically structure these kinds of events with well-paced musical sets that shift with the flow of the day, always family-friendly and upbeat, but without burning people out or dominating the space. Especially with an emcee in place, my role complementsÑnot competes withÑthe programming. [#system #seg-341]
[2025-07-06T00:00:340Z] (positive) IÕd love to hop on a quick call to walk through options, answer any questions, and suggest a few flexible setups that would blend seamlessly with your on-site production crew. [#system #love #seg-341]
